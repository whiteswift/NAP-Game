# NAP-Game

This is a bonus round for a quiz at NET-A-PORTER. You have 3 lives and need to select the most expensive product. Bank your points or lose them if you run out of lives.

It works well on a TV or projector, but it's also responsive so you can use it on your phone too.

Made using vanilla JavaScript so it runs fast and close to the metal ðŸ‘€
